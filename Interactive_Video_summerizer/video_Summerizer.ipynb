No, not those kinds of pandas. Pandas for data science. So pandas is a ridiculously powerful library that's used all around the world for data science. It helps you work, process, and filter tabular data so you can get your machine learning models out there a whole heap faster. And it's probably one of the most useful libraries to have under your belt as a data scientist Let's take a look in detail as to what we're going to be going through So in this video, we're going to be covering CRUD for pandas Now you're probably thinking what the hell is CRUD? Well, it stands for create, read, update, and delete We're basically going to be covering everything you need to get up and started really, really quickly as a data scientist using pandas We're also going to be treating this like a bit of a crash course So we'll read in some tabular data and we'll go through all the steps that you need in order to work with pandas So in terms of how we're going to be doing this, we're going to be working with Python and specifically we're going to be using the pandas library and we're going to be coding inside of a Jupyter notebook because that's what data scientists all around the world are using. So you're ready to get into it. Let's do it. Alright, so let's dive straight into it. So in this video, we're going to go through everything you need to get up and started super fast to work with pandas for data science. So we're going to break up the video into four key sections. So creating data frames, reading data frames, and specifically, we're going to be taking a look at how to work with all the data within them. We're then going to be taking a look at how to update them. So dropping rows and working with columns. And last but not least, we're going to take a look at how we can output all of our resulting data. So the first thing that we're going to want to do is import pandas. Now we can do that pretty easily using the standard Python import functionality. all right so we've imported pandas using the import function so import pandas as pd now if we open up our pandas library and hit tab you can see that we've got a whole bunch of stuff to work with there we're not going to go through all of this we're going to really focus on the 20% that's most important as a data scientist and probably the most important function is read csv so this allows us to create a data frame from a csv and work with it in pandas so in this case we're going to be using read csv to open up our telco churn csv here so if we open this up you can see that it's just a regular old csv with a whole bunch of data and it looks like we've got about 3334 rows 3333 when you exclude our columns let's go ahead and read this in and create a data frame. Alrighty, so we've now just created our data frame. So in order to do that, we use pandas and we used the read CSV function, and then we pass through the name of our CSV. Now you can't actually see the data frame yet because we haven't actually gone and visualized it. Now we're going to skip on over to our read section just for a second to take a look at what this data frame actually looks like. In order to visualize our data frame, the easiest function that you're probably going to want to use is the head function. So this allows you to view the first five rows of data within your data frame. And you can see that we've got our data frame that we just read in. Now as I said, the head function allows us to view the first five rows of data, but if we wanted to view more rows from the top, we can just pass through the number that we want to see. So by passing through 10 to our head function, we're now going to see our first 10 rows of data. Also just to when working with pandas our first row is going to be represented by the index zero. Alrighty, so we've now read in data from a csv and we visualized the first top 10 and top five rows. Now what we want to do is take a look at how we might create a data frame from a dictionary. So a dictionary is just a different python data type but it allows us to work with a bunch of different methods. Also when you're working with pandas you've actually got a whole bunch of read functions here as well. So if you wanted to read in from your clipboard or Excel or read in from HTML, SQL, a whole bunch of other stuff, you can do that as well. Here we're going to be creating a data frame from a dictionary. So what we can do is create a temporary dictionary first. And then what we can do is create a data frame from this dictionary. So in order to do that, we just need to use pandas, access the data frame class, and then call from dict. And you can see we've now created a data frame from a dictionary. So again, we can use the head function to visualize it. So this time we've created a data frame called dictdf. So what we can do is visualize that. And there you go. That's our data frame that we've created from a dictionary. So let's just quickly recap. So in our create section, we took a look at how to create a data frame from a CSV. We then also created one from a dictionary. But as I said, there's a whole bunch of other read functions in pandas that allow you to read in data from different data sources. Now, within our read section, what we're going to be taking a look at is how to view our top five and bottom five rows. So we've already taken a look at how to read in our top five using the head method. We're also going to take a look at how we can view our columns, create summary statistics, filtering, and then working with indexes. So using the iLock and lock functions. So let's go on ahead and finish up our section 2.1. So we wanna view our bottom five rows. Now that's pretty easy. All we need to do is use the tail method to do that. Alrighty, and you can see that we've now used the tail method and this allows us to view our bottom five rows. Again, we can pass through a different number of values if we wanted to view a different number of rows. So again, say we wanted to view our bottom 15. Again, this allows us to view our bottom 15 rows. Alrighty, now on to section 2.2. So viewing columns and different data types. With pandas, you've got a bunch of different columns. So you can see that we've got state, account length, so on and so forth. And we've got enough that we can view on the screen. But when you're working with really big data frames, you might wanna be able to see all the columns that you've got available. To do that, all you need to do is use the columns attribute. And you can now see all the columns that we've got within our data frames. So state, voicemail, total day charge, blah, blah, blah, so on. We can also take a look at the different data types that we've got available within our data frames using the D types attribute. So within our data frame, we've got a number of different data types. So we've got objects, integers, floats. We've also got a churn value as an object. Sometimes you'll also see booleans and a bunch of other different types of data types, but we've pretty much covered the majority of them here. So this just tells us all the different types of data that we've got within our data frame. Now, whenever you're working on a data science project, probably the most important step of the Chris-Damn life cycle is understanding your data. A great way to get a handle on your data is to calculate summary statistics. So we can do this using pandas and specifically using the describe method. So using the describe method, we're able to calculate our count, our mean, standard deviation, min, max, as well as our different quartiles. So this gives us a good overview of what our data actually looks like. But if you pay close attention, when we've called the describe method, it's only being called on the data types that are either integers or floats. What happens if we wanted to calculate the summary statistics on objects, for example? Well we can do this simply by passing through a different parameter to our describe method. So specifically if we call df.describe, what we need to do now is pass through include equals object. So this allows us to calculate summary statistics on our non-float and integer values. So for state, international plan, voicemail plan, and churn, we're now able to get our counts, the number of unique values, as well as our top values, and the frequency. So that pretty much covers summary statistics. Now let's take a look at how we can filter on columns. So we took a look before at all the different columns that we've got. How do we actually filter on the specific columns that we want to visualize? Well, first up, let's actually take a look at how we can grab a single column. So we've got our state column here. How do we go about grabbing that state column? Well, that's pretty easy. All we need to do is access that state value. So you can use it like a bit of a key. Now this can get tricky when you've got keys that have a space in them because if you take a look at international plan here, for example, we can't actually type in DF dot international plan It's going to throw an error in order to get columns that have a space in them We need to do this a little bit differently. So all we do is pass through a square bracket and treat it like a key that way. So again, it's doing the same thing, it's just a different way to grab a column. So that allows us to grab a single column. Now what happens if we wanted to grab multiple columns? Well, right now it doesn't look like we can grab two columns using this method or this method. So in order to grab two columns, what we can do is a similar method to what we use for our international plan, except this time we're going to pass through an array of the columns that we want. And you can see by passing through an array within our data frame sort of index, we're now able to grab both our state and our international plan. I should also note that I'm going to share this entire Jupyter notebook with all the code completed inside a GitHub repository. It'll be in the descriptions below. I'd also love to know what you're using pandas for. Definitely leave a comment in the comments below. Alrighty, so back to our column. So we've now gone and shown our two different columns. Now again, whenever we're performing our exploratory data analysis step using pandas, what we might like to do is find our unique values within each one of these columns. So what we can do is call the unique method to grab our unique values. And just like that, by calling unique on our state column, we're now able to get all the unique values within our data frame. Likewise, say we wanted to call it on our churn column, for example, which we've got here. We can just change that state value to churn and we're now able to see all the unique values within our churn column. So that covers filtering on columns. So we've taken a look at how to grab a single column, how to grab a single column where there's a space in between it, as well as how to grab multiple columns and how to grab unique values. Now what happens if we wanted to filter on rows? Well, let's take a look at the rows that we've got. So say we wanted to grab rows that had international plans set to no. Well, what we can do is use condition-based filtering to grab those values. So by passing through our data frame, then selecting the column that we wanna filter on, as well as the condition, we're able to grab only the values that we want. So this is particularly useful when you wanna filter your data frame or grab a subset of values. Now, you can also filter on two different columns or have multiple conditions. You just need to tweak this code a little bit. So let's copy this. and say we wanted to take a look at values within our data set where customers churned, so customers left our business, and they weren't on the international plan. So international plan is going to stay as no. All we need to do to do that is pass through our different conditions inside of parentheses. So let's put in our first condition inside of a set of parentheses, then pass through an ampersand to represent n, so we're basically concatenating all of these conditions together, and then we wanna pass through our second condition, which is customers that didn't leave the business. So now what we're going to do is specify a different column. So in this case, we're filtering on churn and we want customers that didn't leave, so false. And now you can see that we're actually filtering on both our international plan column as well as our churn column. If we wanted to see customers that weren't on the international plan and did churn, all we need to do is change our second condition to true. And now you can see that we've been able to filter on rows. So what we've done is we've taken a look at our top five columns. We've filtered on rows where international plan equals no. And then we've also done a dual condition filter in order to pass through additional conditions to that filter. Again, you can stack more of these together if you wanted to build bigger filters. Now what we're going to take a look at is how we can index with iLock. So indexing allows you to filter through your data frame, but instead of using specific values or specific conditions, we're going to be using integers. So say we wanted to grab our 15th row within our data frame. Well, we can do this pretty easily using the iLock method. And there you go. We've now grabbed our 15th row. So what we've done there is we've taken our data frame and then we've used the iLock method and then passed through 14. Now you're probably thinking, why 14? Well, remember at the start that I said that your data frame begins at row 0. So if we wanted our 15th row, we just need to subtract one, and this is going to give us a data frame. Now, the iLock function is really, really powerful. So it allows you to hone down and get the specific data that you want. So say, for example, you only wanted the state value as well. Well, we can extend our iLock method and just pass through our first column. So when we pass through two different parameters, the first is going to be your row. The second is going to be your column. So by passing through column zero, we're going to get our first column. And again, you can see we're now getting our state. Likewise, we can also change this and pass through negative one, and it's going to go the other way. So now we're getting our last column, which is churn. Now we can also use the iLock function to do slicing. So say we wanted a subset of our data frame. So rows 22 to 33, for example. Well, what we can do is take a slice of our data frame using the iLock function. So we've used the iLock method the same way, except this time what we've done is we've passed through a segment of our data frame that we want. So we wanna start at row 22 and grab everything to row 33, excluding it. So you can see that we've now gone and grabbed that slice. So that really covers how to work with iLock. So it's really an integer based filtering function. Now we can also work with the lock method. So lock method works a little bit differently to the iLock method in that it uses keywords instead of integers. So in order to do that first, you need to have an index set on your data frame. So right now by default, when we read in our data frame, our index is just going to be created as a set of integers. That's why we've got these numbers here. What we can do is actually set an index on a specific column that we want. So say we wanted to set it on state, we can do that. Alrighty, so you can see that we've now gone and set an index on state. So in order to do that, we took a copy of our data frame, We then went and set our index and passed through the column that we want our index on. And we also passed through the in place parameter. So this is going to allow it to do it in that data frame without having to create a copy of it. Then we've gone and visualized those first top rows and you can see that state is indeed our index. Now what we can do is use the lock method to filter through our data frame and grab the specific rows that we want. So say for example, we only wanted rows which were in Ohio. Well, what we can do is use the lock method to do that. So there you go. So we've just used the lock method to go and filter through our data frame and just grab rows that are situated in Ohio. And that about wraps up our read section. So we've now gone through how to show our top five and bottom five rows, show our columns and data types, create summary statistics, filter, filter on rows. And we've also done some indexing with iLock and lock. Now it's time to get to updating. So the first thing that we're going to take a look at is how to drop rows. So whenever you're pre-processing your data frame, one of the steps that you're probably going to want to do is drop values that have nulls. Now what we can do is actually calculate the rows that have nulls using the isNull method. So by chaining together isNull and sum, we're able to see the number of rows that have missing values. In this case, it's represented by the different columns. So it looks like we've got 10 rows missing total day minutes, 10 missing total day calls, eight missing churn, whole bunch of others there. Now with pandas, we represent these as NAs. So what we can actually do in order to drop these rows is use the drop NA function. So by using drop NA and then passing through in place equals true, we're able to drop all the rows that have missing values. So if we go and visualize this again, you can see that we now have zero missing values within our data frame. So what we did there is we just visualize the number of rows that have missing values, and then we've gone and dropped all of those values. Now, what we can also do is we can drop columns. So say we didn't actually want a column, for example, say we wanted to drop area code, for example. What we can also do is drop a column using the drop method. So let's do that. So simply by using the df.drop method, we're able to drop a column. So in this case, what we've done is we've dropped the area code column, and we've also passed through axis equals one, because in this case, we're dropping a column, we're not dropping a row. What about creating columns? So say, for example, we wanted to create a column, which was the sum of total night minutes and total international minutes. So what we can do is really quickly add a new column and add those together. And there you go, that's how you create a new calculated column. So what we basically did is we grabbed our total night minutes, plus our total international minutes. And then we've added those together and we've put it in a new column called new column. So if we'd go and take a look at these now, you can see that our new column is there on the far right hand side. So what we can also do is say we weren't happy with the values in this. Well, what we can do is update that entire column. So say we wanted everything in here to read 100. Well, we can grab that column and set it equal to 100. Now, if we go and visualize it, everything within that column is reading up as 100. So that's gone and updated everything in that column. What happens if we just wanted to update a single value? For example, our first value here. Well, this is where we can use iLock to go and replace those values. So let's go and grab our first column. And then set it to 10. Now, if we go and visualize that column, you can see that it's now reading as 10. So what we did is we first grabbed the value using iLock. So we grabbed our first row, which is zero, and then we grabbed our last column, which we can access by passing through negative one. And then we set that value to 10. So you can see that that's now reading as 10. Now, the last update methodology that I want to walk you through is how to use the apply function. So the apply function is super powerful because you can basically iterate through every value within a specific column or within your data frame and make updates appropriately using conditions. So say we wanted to take our churn column and rather than it being represented as falses and trues, we wanted it represented as ones and zeros in the new column called churn binary. Well, because there's different conditions there, what we need to do is have a little bit of filtering in order to determine how to update that value. This is where the apply method comes in. and there you go. So we've gone and used the apply method on our churn column, and then we've used lambda to basically iterate through each one of these values, and we've also used a expression here. So we've basically said it's very Pythonic. So we've basically said if x equals true, set it to one, else set it to zero. So if we go and take a look at our columns now, you can see that we now have a churn binary. So let's double check that we've done that for our true values as well. And you can see that if churn equals true, our churn binary equals one. So apply is really, really powerful because you can even pass through functions in here and make updates that way. Just a key point to note out, X is going to represent the value that you're iterating through at a point in time. That's why we've said X equals true. all right and that about wraps up our updating section so what we did is we dropped some rows and we specifically dropped our nas we've also dropped some columns we've created new calculated columns so specifically we added our night minutes plus our international minutes to create our new column here we took a look at how to update an entire column how to update a single value and last but not least we took a look at how we can use the apply method to provide a conditional based updates. The last thing that we're going to do is take a look at our delete and output section. So say we wanted to output a data frame to a CSV, output it to JSON or output it to HTML. This is where we're going to do it. So the first thing that we're going to take a look at is how to output a data frame to a CSV. This is pretty easy. All we need to do is type in df.2csv and then name it. So what we'll do is we'll just call it output for now.csv. This is going to output in the same folder that our Jupyter notebook is in. So you can see if we scroll over here, we've now got an output.csv dataset. So you can see that we've got our columns that we made updates to. Those are all represented within that data frame. Now, likewise, we can also output to JSON. For example, if you're working with different web components, working with JSON is obviously super useful. That's pretty easy. All we need to do is type in to JSON, and it's going to create all of the JSON for our data frame. Likewise, doing it for HTML, sort of similar method. And now we've got a HTML representation of our data frame. So again, we've just passed through two HTML to get the HTML, two JSON to get the JSON. And if we wanted to delete our data frame, all we need to do is type in DELDF. So this is a Python method that allows us to get rid of a specific object. And that about wraps up our last section, which is outputting and deletion. So we outputted CSV, to JSON, to HTML, and last but not least, we deleted our data frame. And that about wraps up this Python crash course. So what we did is we went through how to create data frames, how to make updates to them, how to read them and change data. And last but not least, we also took a look at how we can output our data and delete it. Thanks so much for tuning in, guys. Hopefully you found this video useful.

No, not those kinds of pandas. Pandas for data science. So pandas is a ridiculously powerful library that's used all around the world for data science. It helps you work, process, and filter tabular data so you can get your machine learning models out there a whole heap faster. And it's probably one of the most useful libraries to have under your belt as a data scientist. Let's take a look in detail as to what we're going to be going through. So in this video, we're gonna be covering CRUD for Pandas. Now you're probably thinking, what the hell is CRUD? Well, it stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete. We're basically going to be covering everything you need to get up and started really, really quickly as a data scientist using pandas. We're also gonna be treating this like a bit of a crash course. So we'll read in some tabular data and we'll go through all the steps that you need in order to work with pandas. So in terms of how we're going to be doing this, we're going to be working with Python and specifically we're going to be using the pandas library and we're gonna be coding inside of a of a Jupiter notebook because that's what data scientists all around the world are using. So you're ready to get into it. Let's do it. Alright, so let's dive straight into it. So in this video, we're going to go through everything you need to get up and started super fast to work with pandas for data science. So we're going to break up the video into four key sections. So creating data frames, reading data frames, and specifically we're going to be taking a look at how to work with all the data within them. We're then going to be taking a look at how to update them. So dropping rows and working with columns. And last but not least, we're going to take a look at how we can output all of our resulting data. So the first thing that we're going to want to do is import pandas. Now we can do that pretty easily using the standard Python import functionality. All right. So we've imported pandas using the import function. So import pandas as PD. Now, if we open up our pandas library and hit tab, you can see that we've got a whole bunch of stuff to work with there. We're not going to go through all of this. We're going to really focus on the 20% that's most important as a data scientist. And probably the most important function is read CSV. So this allows us to create a data frame from a CSV and work with it in pandas. So in this case, we're going to be using read CSV to open up our telco churn CSV here. So if we open this up, you can see that it's just a regular old CSV with a whole bunch of data. And it looks like we've got about 3,334 rows, 3,333 when you exclude our columns. Let's go ahead and read this in and create a data frame. Alrighty, so we've now just created our data frame. So in order to do that, we use pandas and we used the read csv function, and then we pass through the name of our csv. Now, you can't actually see the data frame yet because we haven't actually gone and visualized it. Now, we're going to skip on over to our read section just for a second to take a look at what this data frame actually looks like. In order to visualize our data frame, the easiest function that you're probably going to want to use is the head function. So this allows you to view the first five rows of data within your data frame. And you can see that we've got our data frame that we just read in. Now, as I said, the head function allows us to view the first five rows of data. but if we wanted to view more rows from the top we can just pass through the number that we want to see so by passing through 10 to our head function we're now going to see our first 10 rows of data also just to note when working with pandas our first row is going to be represented by the index zero alrighty so we've now read in data from a csv and we visualized the first top 10 and top five rows. Now what we want to do is take a look at how we might create a data frame from a dictionary. So a dictionary is just a different Python data type, but it allows us to work with a bunch of different methods. Also, when you're working with pandas, you've actually got a whole bunch of read functions here as well. So if you wanted to read in from your clipboard or Excel or read in from HTML, SQL, a whole bunch of other stuff, you can do that as well. Here we're going to be creating a data frame from a dictionary. So what we can do is create a temporary dictionary first. And then what we can do is create a data frame from this dictionary. So in order to do that, we just need to use pandas, access the data frame class, and then call from dict. And you can see we've now created a data frame from a dictionary. So again, we can use the head function to visualize it. So this time we've created a data frame called dictdf. So what we can do is visualize that. And there you go. That's our data frame that we've created from a dictionary. So let's just quickly recap. So in our create section, we took a look at how to create a data frame from a CSV. We then also created one from a dictionary. But as I said, there's a whole bunch of other read functions in pandas that allow you to read in data from different data sources. Now within our read section, what we're going to be taking a look at is how to view our top five and bottom five rows. So we've already taken a look at how to read in our top five using the head method. We're also going to take a look at how we can view our columns, create summary statistics, filtering, and then working with indexes. So using the iLock and lock functions. So let's go on ahead and finish up our section 2.1. So we want to view our bottom five rows. Now that's pretty easy. All we need to do is use the tail method to do that. Alrighty, and you can see that we've now used the tail method and this allows us to view our bottom five rows. Again, we can pass through a different number of values if we wanted to view a different number of rows. So again, say we wanted to view our bottom 15. Again, this allows us to view our bottom 15 rows. Alrighty, now on to section 2.2. So viewing columns and different data types. With pandas, you've got a bunch of different columns. So you can see that we've got state, account length, so on and so forth. And we've got enough that we can view on the screen. But when you're working with really big data frames you might want to be able to see all the columns that you've got available. To do that all you need to do is use the columns attribute. And you can now see all the columns that we've got within our data frame so state voicemail total day charge blah blah blah so on we can also take a look at the different data types that we've got available within our data frames using the d types attribute so within our data frame we've got a number of different data types so we've got objects integers floats we've also got our churn value as an object. Sometimes you'll also see booleans and a bunch of other different types of data types, but we've pretty much covered the majority of them here. So this just tells us all the different types of data that we've got within our data frame. Now, whenever you're working on a data science project, probably the most important step of the Chris Dam cycle is understanding your data. A great way to get a handle on your data is to calculate summary statistics. So we can do this using pandas and specifically using the describe method. So using the describe method, we're able to calculate our count, our mean, standard deviation, min, max, as well as our different quartiles. So this gives us a good overview of what our data actually looks like. But if you pay close attention, when we've called the describe method, it's only being called on the data types that are either integers or floats. What happens if we wanted to calculate the summary statistics on objects, for example? Well, we can do this simply by passing through a different parameter to our describe method. So specifically, if we call df.describe, what we need to do now is pass through include equals object. So this allows us to calculate summary statistics on our non-float and integer values. So for state, international plan, voicemail plan, and churn, we're now able to get our counts, the number of unique values, as well as our top values values and the frequency. So that pretty much covers summary statistics. Now let's take a look at how we can filter on columns. So we took a look before at all the different columns that we've got. How do we actually filter on the specific columns that we want to visualize? Well, first up, let's actually take a look at how we can grab a single column. So we've got our state column here. How do we go about grabbing that state column? Well, that's pretty easy. All we need to do is access that state value. So you can use it like a bit of a key. Now, this can get tricky when you've got keys that have a space in them, because if you take a look at international plan here, for example, we can't actually type in DF dot international plan, it's going to throw an error in order to get columns that have a space in them we need to do this a little bit differently so all we do is pass through a square bracket and treat it like a key that way so again it's doing the same thing it's just a different way to grab a column so that allows us to grab a single column now what happens if we wanted to grab multiple columns well right now it doesn't look like we can grab two columns using this method or this method so in order to grab two columns what we can do is a similar method to what we use for our international plan except this time we're going to pass through an array of the columns that we want. And you can see by passing through an array within our data frame sort of index we're now able to grab both our state and our international plan. I should also note that I'm gonna share this entire Jupyter notebook with all the code completed inside a GitHub repository. It'll be in the descriptions below. I'd also love to know what you're using pandas for. Definitely leave a comment in the comments below. Alrighty, so back to our column. So we've now gone and shown our two different columns. Now, again, whenever we're performing our exploratory data analysis step using pandas what we might like to do is find our unique values within each one of these columns so what we can do is call the unique method to grab our unique values and just like that by calling unique on our state column we're now able to get all the unique values within our data frame likewise say we wanted to call it on our state column, we're now able to get all the unique values within our data frame. Likewise, say we wanted to call it on our churn column, for example, which we've got here, we can just change that state value to churn, and we're now able to see all the unique values within our churn column. So that covers filtering on columns. So we've taken a look at how to grab a single column, how to grab a single column, how to grab a single column where there's a space in between it, as well as how to grab multiple columns and how to grab unique values. Now what happens if we wanted to filter on rows? Well, let's take a look at the rows that we've got. So say we wanted to grab rows that had international plans set to no. Well, what we can do is use condition based filtering to grab those values. So by passing through our data frame, then selecting the column that we wanna filter on, as well as the condition, we're able to grab only the values that we want. So this is particularly useful when you wanna filter your data frame or grab a subset of values. Now you can also filter on two different columns or have multiple conditions. You just need to tweak this code a little bit. So let's copy this. And say we wanted to take a look at values within our data set where customers churned, so customers left our business and they weren't on the international plan. So international plan is going to stay as no. All we need to do to do that is pass through our different conditions inside of parentheses. So let's put in our first condition inside of a set of parentheses, then pass through an ampersand to represent N. So we're basically concatenating all of these conditions together. And then we wanna pass through our second condition, which is customers that didn't leave the business. So now what we're going to do is specify a different column. So in this case, we're filtering on churn and we want customers that didn't leave, so false. And now you can see that we're actually filtering on both our international plan column as well as our churn column. If we wanted to see customers that weren't on the international plan and did churn, all we need to do is change our second condition to true. And now you can see that we've been able to filter on rows. So what we've done is we've taken a look at our top five columns, we've filtered on rows where international plan equals no, and then we've also done a dual condition filter in order to pass through additional conditions to that filter. Again, you can stack more of these together if you wanted to build bigger filters. Now what we're going to take a look at is how we can index with iLock. So indexing allows you to filter through your data frame, but instead of using specific values or specific conditions, we're going to be using integers. So say we wanted to grab our 15th row within our data frame. Well, we can do this pretty easily using the iLock method. And there you go, we've now grabbed our 15th row. So what we've done there is we've taken our data frame and then we've used the iLock method and then passed through 14. Now you're probably thinking, why 14? Well, remember at the start that I said that your data frame begins at row zero. So if we wanted our 15th row, we just need to subtract one and this is going to give us a data frame. Now the i wanted our 15th row, we just need to subtract one. And this is going to give us a data frame. Now the iLock function is really, really powerful. So it allows you to hone down and get the specific data that you want. So say for example, you only wanted the state value as well. Well, we can extend our iLock method and just pass through our first column. So when we pass through two different parameters, the first is going to be your row, the second is going to be your column. So by passing through column zero, we're going to get our first column. And again, you can see we're now getting our state. Likewise, we can also change this and pass through negative one, and it's going to go the other way. So now we're getting our last column, which is churn. Now we can also use the iLock function to do slicing. So say we wanted a subset of our data frame. So rows 22 to 33, for example. Well, what we can do is take a slice of our data frame using the iLock function. So we've used the iLock method the same way, except this time what we've done is we've passed through a segment of our data frame that we want. So we wanna start at row 22 and grab everything to row 33, excluding it. So you can see that we've now gone and grabbed that slice. So that really covers how to work with iLock. So it's really an integer based filtering function. Now we can also work with the lock method. So lock method works a little bit differently to the iLock method in that it uses keywords instead of integers. So in order to do that first, you need to have an index set on your data frame. So right now, by default, when we read in our data frame, our index is just going to be created as a set of integers. That's why we've got these numbers here. What we can do is actually set an index on a specific column that we want. So say we wanted to set it on state, we can do that. Alrighty, so you can see that we've now gone and set an index on state. So in order to do that, we took a copy of our data frame. We then went and set our index and passed through the column that we want our index on. And we also passed through the in place parameter. So this is going to allow it to do it in that data frame without having to create a copy of it. Then we've gone and visualized those first top rows, and you can see that state is indeed our index. Now what we can do is use the lock method to filter through our data frame and grab the specific rows that we want. So say for example, we only wanted rows which were in Ohio. Well, what we can do is use the lock method to do that. So there you go. So we've just used the lock method to go and filter through our data frame and just grab rows that are situated in Ohio. And that about wraps up our read section. So we've now gone through how to show our top five and bottom five rows, show our columns and data types, create summary statistics, filter, filter on rows, and we've also done some indexing with iLock and Lock. Now it's time to get to updating. So the first thing that we're going to take a look at is how to drop rows. So whenever you're pre-processing your data frame, one of the steps that you're probably going to want to do is drop values that have nulls Now what we can do is actually calculate the rows that have nulls using the is null method So by training together is null and sum we're able to see the number of rows that have missing values In this case, it's represented by the different columns So it looks like we've got ten rows missing total day minutes, 10 missing total day calls, eight missing churn, whole bunch of others there. Now with pandas, we represent these as NAs. So what we can actually do in order to drop these rows is use the drop NA function. So by using drop NA and then passing through in place equals true, we're able to drop all the rows that have missing values. So if we go and visualize this again, you can see that we now have zero missing values within our data frame. So what we did there is we just visualize the number of rows that have missing values, and then we've gone and dropped all of those values. Now what we can also do is we can drop columns. So say we didn't actually want a column, for example, say we wanted to drop area code, for example. What we can also do is drop a column using the drop method so let's do that so simply by using the df.drop method we're able to drop a column so in this case what we've done is we've dropped the area code column and we've also passed through access equals one because in this case we're dropping a column we're not dropping a row what about creating columns so say for example case we're dropping a column we're not dropping a row what about creating columns so say for example we wanted to create a column which was the sum of total night minutes and total international minutes so what we can do is really quickly add a new column and add those together and there you go that's how you create a new calculator column. So what we basically did is we grabbed our total night minutes plus our total international minutes, and then we've added those together, and we've put it in a new column called new column. So if we go and take a look at these now, you can see that our new column is there on the far right hand side. So what we can also do is say we weren't happy with the values in this. Well, what we can do is update that entire column. So say we wanted everything in here to read 100. Well, we can grab that column and set it equal to 100. Now, if we go and visualize it, everything within that column is reading up as 100. So that's gone and updated everything in that column. What happens if we just wanted to update a single value? For example, our first value here. Well, this is where we can use iLock to go and replace those values. So let's go and grab our first column and then set it to 10. Now, if we go and visualize that column, you can see that it's now reading as 10. So what we did is we first grabbed the value using iLock so we grabbed our first row which is zero and then we grabbed our last column which we can access by passing through negative one and then we set that value to 10. So you can see that that's now reading as 10. Now the last update methodology that I want to walk you through is how to use the apply function. So the apply function is super powerful because you can basically iterate through every value within a specific column or within your data frame and make updates appropriately using conditions. So say we wanted to take our churn column and rather than it being represented as falses and trues, we wanted it represented as ones and zeros in the new column called churn binary. Well, because there's different conditions there, what we need to do is have a little bit of filtering in order to determine how to update that value. This is where the apply method comes in. And there you go. So we've gone and used the apply method on our churn column. And then we've used lambda to basically iterate through each one of these values. And we've also used a expression here. So we've basically said it's very Pythonic. So we've basically said if x equals true, set it to one else set it to zero. So if we go and take a look at our columns now, you can see that we now have a churn binary. So let's double check that we've done that for our true values as well and you can see that if churn equals true our churn binary equals one so apply is really really powerful because you can even pass through functions in here and make updates that way just a key point to note out X is going to represent the value that you're iterating through at a point in time. That's why we've said X equals true. All right, and that about wraps up our updating section. So what we did is we dropped some rows and we specifically dropped out NAs. We've also dropped some columns. We've created new calculated columns. So specifically, we added our night minutes plus our international minutes to create our new column here. We took a look at how to update an entire column, how to update a single value. And last but not least, we took a look at how we can use the apply method to provide conditional based updates. The last thing that we're going to do is take a look at our delete and output section. So say we wanted to output a data frame to a CSV, output it to JSON or output it to HTML. This is where we're going to do it. So the first thing that we're going to take a look at is how to output a data frame to a CSV. This is pretty easy. All we need to do is type in df.2csv and then name it. So what we'll do is we'll just call it output for now.csv. This is going to output in the same folder that our Jupyter Notebook is in. So you can see if we scroll over here, we've now got an output.csv dataset. So you can see that we've got our columns that we made updates to. Those are all represented within that data frame. Now, likewise, we can also output to JSON. For example, if you're working with different web components, working with JSON is obviously super useful. That's pretty easy. All we need to do is type in to JSON, and it's going to create all of the JSON for our data frame. Likewise, doing it for HTML, sort of similar method. And now we've got a HTML representation of our data frame. So again, we've just passed through to HTML to get the HTML, to JSON to get the JSON, and if we wanted to delete our data frame, all we need to do is type in DEL, DF. So this is a Python method that allows us to get rid of a specific object. And that about wraps up our last section, which is outputting and deletion. So we output it to CSV, to JSON, to HTML. And last but not least, we deleted our data frame. And that about wraps up this Python crash course. So what we did is we went through how to create data frames, how to make updates to them, how to read them and change data. And last but not least, we also took a look at how we can output our data and delete it. Thanks so much for tuning in, guys. Hopefully you found this video useful.

So you're ready to get into it. Let's do it. Alright, so let's dive straight into it. So in this video, we're going to go through everything you need to get up and started super fast to work with pandas for data science. So we're going to break up the video into four key sections. So creating data frames, reading data frames, and specifically we're going to be taking a look at how to work with all the data within them.\n","(89.0, 92.0)-\u003e We're then going to be taking a look at how to update them.\n","(92.0, 94.0)-\u003e So dropping rows and working with columns.\n","(94.0, 99.0)-\u003e And last but not least, we're going to take a look at how we can output all of our resulting data.\n","(99.0, 103.0)-\u003e So the first thing that we're going to want to do is import pandas.\n","(103.0, 107.08)-\u003e Now we can do that pretty easily using the standard Python import functionality.\n","(108.32, 108.92)-\u003e All right.\n","(108.98, 111.64)-\u003e So we've imported pandas using the import function.\n","(111.64, 113.38)-\u003e So import pandas as PD.\n","(113.86, 120.76)-\u003e Now, if we open up our pandas library and hit tab, you can see that we've got a whole bunch of stuff to work with there.\n","(121.0, 122.26)-\u003e We're not going to go through all of this.\n","(122.26, 129.52)-\u003e We're going to really focus on the 20% that's most important as a data scientist. And probably the most important function is read\n","(129.52, 135.74)-\u003e CSV. So this allows us to create a data frame from a CSV and work with it in pandas. So in this case,\n","(135.74, 141.04)-\u003e we're going to be using read CSV to open up our telco churn CSV here. So if we open this up,\n","(141.56, 148.8)-\u003e you can see that it's just a regular old CSV with a whole bunch of data.\n","(148.94, 155.9)-\u003e And it looks like we've got about 3,334 rows, 3,333 when you exclude our columns.\n","(156.68, 159.7)-\u003e Let's go ahead and read this in and create a data frame.\n","(162.72, 165.28)-\u003e Alrighty, so we've now just created our data frame.\n","(165.4, 172.9)-\u003e So in order to do that, we use pandas and we used the read csv function, and then we pass through the name of our csv.\n","(172.9, 177.5)-\u003e Now, you can't actually see the data frame yet because we haven't actually gone and visualized it.\n","(177.6, 185.44)-\u003e Now, we're going to skip on over to our read section just for a second to take a look at what this data frame actually looks like. In order to visualize our\n","(185.44, 190.2)-\u003e data frame, the easiest function that you're probably going to want to use is the head function.\n","(190.34, 195.98)-\u003e So this allows you to view the first five rows of data within your data frame. And you can see\n","(195.98, 201.9)-\u003e that we've got our data frame that we just read in. Now, as I said, the head function allows us to\n","(201.9, 205.6)-\u003e view the first five rows of data. but if we wanted to view more rows\n","(205.6, 210.96)-\u003e from the top we can just pass through the number that we want to see so by passing through 10 to\n","(210.96, 216.56)-\u003e our head function we're now going to see our first 10 rows of data also just to note when working\n","(216.56, 223.04)-\u003e with pandas our first row is going to be represented by the index zero alrighty so we've now read in\n","(223.04, 227.26)-\u003e data from a csv and we visualized the first top 10 and top\n","(227.26, 232.32)-\u003e five rows. Now what we want to do is take a look at how we might create a data frame from a dictionary.\n","(232.52, 237.8)-\u003e So a dictionary is just a different Python data type, but it allows us to work with a bunch of\n","(237.8, 242.76)-\u003e different methods. Also, when you're working with pandas, you've actually got a whole bunch of read\n","(242.76, 247.12)-\u003e functions here as well. So if you wanted to read in from your clipboard or Excel\n","(247.12, 250.38)-\u003e or read in from HTML, SQL, a whole bunch of other stuff,\n","(250.38, 251.76)-\u003e you can do that as well.\n","(251.76, 253.54)-\u003e Here we're going to be creating a data frame\n","(253.54, 254.38)-\u003e from a dictionary.\n","(254.38, 257.76)-\u003e So what we can do is create a temporary dictionary first.\n","(264.28, 268.36)-\u003e And then what we can do is create a data frame from this dictionary. So in order to do that,\n","(268.36, 273.08)-\u003e we just need to use pandas, access the data frame class, and then call from dict.\n","(276.62, 280.1)-\u003e And you can see we've now created a data frame from a dictionary. So again,\n","(280.2, 290.96)-\u003e we can use the head function to visualize it. So this time we've created a data frame called dictdf. So what we can do is visualize that. And there you go. That's our data frame that we've\n","(290.96, 296.66)-\u003e created from a dictionary. So let's just quickly recap. So in our create section, we took a look\n","(296.66, 302.02)-\u003e at how to create a data frame from a CSV. We then also created one from a dictionary. But as I said,\n","(302.12, 310.74)-\u003e there's a whole bunch of other read functions in pandas that allow you to read in data from different data sources. Now within our read\n","(310.74, 315.6)-\u003e section, what we're going to be taking a look at is how to view our top five and bottom five rows.\n","(315.9, 320.02)-\u003e So we've already taken a look at how to read in our top five using the head method. We're also\n","(320.02, 325.0)-\u003e going to take a look at how we can view our columns, create summary statistics, filtering,\n","(325.0, 330.68)-\u003e and then working with indexes. So using the iLock and lock functions. So let's go on ahead and finish\n","(330.68, 336.26)-\u003e up our section 2.1. So we want to view our bottom five rows. Now that's pretty easy. All we need to\n","(336.26, 342.36)-\u003e do is use the tail method to do that. Alrighty, and you can see that we've now used the tail\n","(342.36, 345.6)-\u003e method and this allows us to view our bottom five rows.\n","(345.92, 350.48)-\u003e Again, we can pass through a different number of values if we wanted to view a different number of rows.\n","(351.44, 353.6)-\u003e So again, say we wanted to view our bottom 15.\n","(354.24, 358.0)-\u003e Again, this allows us to view our bottom 15 rows.\n","(358.72, 361.36)-\u003e Alrighty, now on to section 2.2.\n","(361.46, 363.94)-\u003e So viewing columns and different data types.\n","(364.46, 366.16)-\u003e With pandas, you've got a bunch of\n","(366.16, 370.44)-\u003e different columns. So you can see that we've got state, account length, so on and so forth.\n","(370.52, 373.94)-\u003e And we've got enough that we can view on the screen. But when you're working with really big\n","(373.94, 378.56)-\u003e data frames you might want to be able to see all the columns that you've got available. To do that\n","(378.56, 385.38)-\u003e all you need to do is use the columns attribute. And you can now see all the columns that we've got within our data frame so\n","(385.38, 391.58)-\u003e state voicemail total day charge blah blah blah so on we can also take a look at the different data\n","(391.58, 397.1)-\u003e types that we've got available within our data frames using the d types attribute so within our\n","(397.1, 402.74)-\u003e data frame we've got a number of different data types so we've got objects integers floats we've\n","(402.74, 406.76)-\u003e also got our churn value as an object. Sometimes you'll also\n","(406.76, 411.44)-\u003e see booleans and a bunch of other different types of data types, but we've pretty much covered the\n","(411.44, 416.6)-\u003e majority of them here. So this just tells us all the different types of data that we've got within\n","(416.6, 421.42)-\u003e our data frame. Now, whenever you're working on a data science project, probably the most important\n","(421.42, 425.26)-\u003e step of the Chris Dam cycle is understanding your data.\n","(428.82, 429.18)-\u003e A great way to get a handle on your data is to calculate summary statistics.\n","(433.78, 435.22)-\u003e So we can do this using pandas and specifically using the describe method.\n","(443.22, 443.28)-\u003e So using the describe method, we're able to calculate our count, our mean, standard deviation, min, max, as well as our different quartiles.\n","(445.16, 449.74)-\u003e So this gives us a good overview of what our data actually looks like. But if you pay close attention, when we've called the describe\n","(449.74, 456.02)-\u003e method, it's only being called on the data types that are either integers or floats. What happens\n","(456.02, 461.14)-\u003e if we wanted to calculate the summary statistics on objects, for example? Well, we can do this\n","(461.14, 470.3)-\u003e simply by passing through a different parameter to our describe method. So specifically, if we call df.describe, what we need to do now is pass through include equals object.\n","(471.4, 476.98)-\u003e So this allows us to calculate summary statistics on our non-float and integer values.\n","(477.16, 482.3)-\u003e So for state, international plan, voicemail plan, and churn, we're now able to get our counts,\n","(482.46, 488.8)-\u003e the number of unique values, as well as our top values values and the frequency. So that pretty much covers summary statistics. Now let's take a\n","(488.8, 493.46)-\u003e look at how we can filter on columns. So we took a look before at all the different columns that\n","(493.46, 497.74)-\u003e we've got. How do we actually filter on the specific columns that we want to visualize? Well,\n","(498.08, 503.24)-\u003e first up, let's actually take a look at how we can grab a single column. So we've got our state\n","(503.24, 505.32)-\u003e column here. How do we go about grabbing that\n","(505.32, 510.58)-\u003e state column? Well, that's pretty easy. All we need to do is access that state value. So you can use\n","(510.58, 515.78)-\u003e it like a bit of a key. Now, this can get tricky when you've got keys that have a space in them,\n","(515.78, 521.08)-\u003e because if you take a look at international plan here, for example, we can't actually type in DF\n","(521.08, 526.0)-\u003e dot international plan, it's going to throw an error in order to get columns\n","(526.0, 528.94)-\u003e that have a space in them we need to do this a little bit differently so all we\n","(528.94, 533.32)-\u003e do is pass through a square bracket and treat it like a key that way so again\n","(533.32, 536.82)-\u003e it's doing the same thing it's just a different way to grab a column so that\n","(536.82, 539.92)-\u003e allows us to grab a single column now what happens if we wanted to grab\n","(539.92, 543.7)-\u003e multiple columns well right now it doesn't look like we can grab two\n","(543.7, 548.16)-\u003e columns using this method or this method so in order to grab two columns what we can do\n","(548.16, 551.86)-\u003e is a similar method to what we use for our international plan except this time\n","(551.86, 558.3)-\u003e we're going to pass through an array of the columns that we want. And you can see\n","(558.3, 563.7)-\u003e by passing through an array within our data frame sort of index we're now able\n","(563.7, 566.3)-\u003e to grab both our state and our international plan.\n","(566.68, 568.06)-\u003e I should also note that I'm gonna share\n","(568.06, 569.5)-\u003e this entire Jupyter notebook\n","(569.5, 572.7)-\u003e with all the code completed inside a GitHub repository.\n","(573.16, 574.54)-\u003e It'll be in the descriptions below.\n","(574.9, 577.0)-\u003e I'd also love to know what you're using pandas for.\n","(577.16, 579.06)-\u003e Definitely leave a comment in the comments below.\n","(579.24, 580.8)-\u003e Alrighty, so back to our column.\n","(580.9, 583.6)-\u003e So we've now gone and shown our two different columns.\n","(584.0, 590.24)-\u003e Now, again, whenever we're performing our exploratory data analysis step using pandas what we might like to do is find\n","(590.24, 595.76)-\u003e our unique values within each one of these columns so what we can do is call the unique method to\n","(595.76, 601.84)-\u003e grab our unique values and just like that by calling unique on our state column we're now\n","(601.84, 605.06)-\u003e able to get all the unique values within our data frame likewise say we wanted to call it on our state column, we're now able to get all the unique values within our data frame.\n","(605.42, 612.72)-\u003e Likewise, say we wanted to call it on our churn column, for example, which we've got here,\n","(612.72, 619.86)-\u003e we can just change that state value to churn, and we're now able to see all the unique values\n","(619.86, 624.98)-\u003e within our churn column. So that covers filtering on columns. So we've taken a look at how to grab\n","(624.98, 626.68)-\u003e a single column, how to grab a single column,\n","(626.68, 627.84)-\u003e how to grab a single column\n","(627.84, 629.5)-\u003e where there's a space in between it,\n","(629.5, 631.12)-\u003e as well as how to grab multiple columns\n","(631.12, 633.0)-\u003e and how to grab unique values.\n","(633.0, 635.44)-\u003e Now what happens if we wanted to filter on rows?\n","(635.44, 638.5)-\u003e Well, let's take a look at the rows that we've got.\n","(638.5, 640.46)-\u003e So say we wanted to grab rows\n","(640.46, 643.22)-\u003e that had international plans set to no.\n","(643.22, 645.64)-\u003e Well, what we can do is use condition based filtering\n","(645.64, 647.02)-\u003e to grab those values.\n","(650.16, 651.92)-\u003e So by passing through our data frame,\n","(651.92, 654.38)-\u003e then selecting the column that we wanna filter on,\n","(654.38, 655.66)-\u003e as well as the condition,\n","(655.66, 658.44)-\u003e we're able to grab only the values that we want.\n","(658.44, 659.66)-\u003e So this is particularly useful\n","(659.66, 661.36)-\u003e when you wanna filter your data frame\n","(661.36, 663.36)-\u003e or grab a subset of values.\n","(663.36, 665.46)-\u003e Now you can also filter on two different columns\n","(665.46, 670.22)-\u003e or have multiple conditions. You just need to tweak this code a little bit. So let's copy this.\n","(671.68, 677.24)-\u003e And say we wanted to take a look at values within our data set where customers churned,\n","(677.26, 681.98)-\u003e so customers left our business and they weren't on the international plan. So international plan\n","(681.98, 685.52)-\u003e is going to stay as no. All we need to do to do that is pass through\n","(685.52, 688.16)-\u003e our different conditions inside of parentheses.\n","(688.16, 689.76)-\u003e So let's put in our first condition\n","(689.76, 691.64)-\u003e inside of a set of parentheses,\n","(691.64, 693.98)-\u003e then pass through an ampersand to represent N.\n","(693.98, 695.58)-\u003e So we're basically concatenating\n","(695.58, 697.16)-\u003e all of these conditions together.\n","(697.16, 699.24)-\u003e And then we wanna pass through our second condition,\n","(699.24, 701.9)-\u003e which is customers that didn't leave the business.\n","(701.9, 704.66)-\u003e So now what we're going to do is specify a different column.\n","(704.66, 706.36)-\u003e So in this case, we're filtering on churn\n","(706.36, 709.82)-\u003e and we want customers that didn't leave, so false.\n","(711.18, 713.34)-\u003e And now you can see that we're actually filtering\n","(713.34, 715.3)-\u003e on both our international plan column\n","(715.3, 717.04)-\u003e as well as our churn column.\n","(717.22, 718.56)-\u003e If we wanted to see customers\n","(718.56, 721.38)-\u003e that weren't on the international plan and did churn,\n","(721.56, 724.62)-\u003e all we need to do is change our second condition to true.\n","(725.92, 728.98)-\u003e And now you can see that we've been able to filter on rows.\n","(728.98, 730.76)-\u003e So what we've done is we've taken a look\n","(730.76, 733.38)-\u003e at our top five columns, we've filtered on rows\n","(733.38, 735.28)-\u003e where international plan equals no,\n","(735.28, 738.64)-\u003e and then we've also done a dual condition filter\n","(738.64, 741.06)-\u003e in order to pass through additional conditions\n","(741.06, 742.1)-\u003e to that filter.\n","(742.1, 743.86)-\u003e Again, you can stack more of these together\n","(743.86, 750.98)-\u003e if you wanted to build bigger filters. Now what we're going to take a look at is how we can index with iLock. So indexing\n","(750.98, 756.18)-\u003e allows you to filter through your data frame, but instead of using specific values or specific\n","(756.18, 762.16)-\u003e conditions, we're going to be using integers. So say we wanted to grab our 15th row within our\n","(762.16, 765.8)-\u003e data frame. Well, we can do this pretty easily using the iLock method.\n","(767.0, 769.56)-\u003e And there you go, we've now grabbed our 15th row.\n","(769.56, 772.14)-\u003e So what we've done there is we've taken our data frame\n","(772.14, 773.94)-\u003e and then we've used the iLock method\n","(773.94, 775.68)-\u003e and then passed through 14.\n","(775.68, 777.42)-\u003e Now you're probably thinking, why 14?\n","(777.42, 778.84)-\u003e Well, remember at the start that I said\n","(778.84, 781.32)-\u003e that your data frame begins at row zero.\n","(781.32, 784.5)-\u003e So if we wanted our 15th row, we just need to subtract one\n","(784.5, 785.44)-\u003e and this is going to give us a data frame. Now the i wanted our 15th row, we just need to subtract one. And this is going to\n","(785.44, 789.88)-\u003e give us a data frame. Now the iLock function is really, really powerful. So it allows you to hone\n","(789.88, 794.82)-\u003e down and get the specific data that you want. So say for example, you only wanted the state value\n","(794.82, 801.54)-\u003e as well. Well, we can extend our iLock method and just pass through our first column. So when we\n","(801.54, 805.12)-\u003e pass through two different parameters, the first is going to be your row,\n","(809.46, 816.0)-\u003e the second is going to be your column. So by passing through column zero, we're going to get our first column. And again, you can see we're now getting our state. Likewise, we can also change\n","(816.0, 820.7)-\u003e this and pass through negative one, and it's going to go the other way. So now we're getting our last\n","(820.7, 825.04)-\u003e column, which is churn. Now we can also use the iLock function to do slicing.\n","(825.04, 827.28)-\u003e So say we wanted a subset of our data frame.\n","(827.28, 830.36)-\u003e So rows 22 to 33, for example.\n","(830.36, 832.8)-\u003e Well, what we can do is take a slice of our data frame\n","(832.8, 834.16)-\u003e using the iLock function.\n","(835.68, 838.0)-\u003e So we've used the iLock method the same way,\n","(838.0, 840.44)-\u003e except this time what we've done is we've passed through\n","(840.44, 842.56)-\u003e a segment of our data frame that we want.\n","(842.56, 844.9)-\u003e So we wanna start at row 22 and grab everything\n","(844.9, 846.44)-\u003e to row 33, excluding it.\n","(846.44, 850.4)-\u003e So you can see that we've now gone and grabbed that slice.\n","(850.72, 852.64)-\u003e So that really covers how to work with iLock.\n","(852.64, 856.08)-\u003e So it's really an integer based filtering function.\n","(857.24, 859.28)-\u003e Now we can also work with the lock method.\n","(859.28, 862.16)-\u003e So lock method works a little bit differently to the iLock method\n","(862.16, 865.1)-\u003e in that it uses keywords instead of integers.\n","(865.64, 870.62)-\u003e So in order to do that first, you need to have an index set on your data frame. So right now,\n","(870.68, 875.5)-\u003e by default, when we read in our data frame, our index is just going to be created as a set of\n","(875.5, 880.02)-\u003e integers. That's why we've got these numbers here. What we can do is actually set an index\n","(880.02, 890.0)-\u003e on a specific column that we want. So say we wanted to set it on state, we can do that.\n","(891.88, 893.6)-\u003e Alrighty, so you can see that we've now gone and set an index on state.\n","(893.78, 896.52)-\u003e So in order to do that, we took a copy of our data frame.\n","(896.72, 898.62)-\u003e We then went and set our index\n","(898.62, 901.28)-\u003e and passed through the column that we want our index on.\n","(901.46, 903.78)-\u003e And we also passed through the in place parameter.\n","(903.94, 910.12)-\u003e So this is going to allow it to do it in that data frame without having to create a copy of it. Then we've gone and visualized\n","(910.12, 915.76)-\u003e those first top rows, and you can see that state is indeed our index. Now what we can do is use\n","(915.76, 920.74)-\u003e the lock method to filter through our data frame and grab the specific rows that we want. So say\n","(920.74, 925.9)-\u003e for example, we only wanted rows which were in Ohio. Well, what we can do is use\n","(925.9, 932.04)-\u003e the lock method to do that. So there you go. So we've just used the lock method to go and filter\n","(932.04, 937.2)-\u003e through our data frame and just grab rows that are situated in Ohio. And that about wraps up\n","(937.2, 948.64)-\u003e our read section. So we've now gone through how to show our top five and bottom five rows, show our columns and data types, create summary statistics,\n","(948.64, 955.68)-\u003e filter, filter on rows, and we've also done some indexing with iLock and Lock. Now it's time to get\n","(955.68, 960.64)-\u003e to updating. So the first thing that we're going to take a look at is how to drop rows. So whenever\n","(960.64, 964.4)-\u003e you're pre-processing your data frame, one of the steps that you're probably going to want to do is\n","(964.4, 966.14)-\u003e drop values that have nulls\n","(966.24, 970.72)-\u003e Now what we can do is actually calculate the rows that have nulls using the is null method\n","(971.72, 977.66)-\u003e So by training together is null and sum we're able to see the number of rows that have missing values\n","(977.66, 979.94)-\u003e In this case, it's represented by the different columns\n","(979.94, 986.52)-\u003e So it looks like we've got ten rows missing total day minutes, 10 missing total day calls,\n","(986.52, 988.4)-\u003e eight missing churn, whole bunch of others there.\n","(988.4, 991.4)-\u003e Now with pandas, we represent these as NAs.\n","(991.4, 993.66)-\u003e So what we can actually do in order to drop these rows\n","(993.66, 995.72)-\u003e is use the drop NA function.\n","(997.76, 1000.04)-\u003e So by using drop NA and then passing through\n","(1000.04, 1001.54)-\u003e in place equals true,\n","(1001.54, 1004.18)-\u003e we're able to drop all the rows that have missing values.\n","(1004.18, 1010.02)-\u003e So if we go and visualize this again, you can see that we now have zero missing values within our data frame.\n","(1010.38, 1014.5)-\u003e So what we did there is we just visualize the number of rows that have missing values, and then\n","(1014.5, 1019.7)-\u003e we've gone and dropped all of those values. Now what we can also do is we can drop columns. So say\n","(1019.7, 1024.18)-\u003e we didn't actually want a column, for example, say we wanted to drop area code, for example. What we\n","(1024.18, 1034.16)-\u003e can also do is drop a column using the drop method so let's do that so simply by using the df.drop method we're\n","(1034.16, 1039.36)-\u003e able to drop a column so in this case what we've done is we've dropped the area code column and\n","(1039.36, 1044.08)-\u003e we've also passed through access equals one because in this case we're dropping a column we're not\n","(1044.08, 1045.12)-\u003e dropping a row what about creating columns so say for example case we're dropping a column we're not dropping a row\n","(1045.12, 1050.08)-\u003e what about creating columns so say for example we wanted to create a column which was the sum of\n","(1050.08, 1054.8)-\u003e total night minutes and total international minutes so what we can do is really quickly\n","(1054.8, 1056.64)-\u003e add a new column and add those together\n","(1062.96, 1065.54)-\u003e and there you go that's how you create a new calculator column.\n","(1065.66, 1070.86)-\u003e So what we basically did is we grabbed our total night minutes plus our total international minutes,\n","(1070.86, 1075.72)-\u003e and then we've added those together, and we've put it in a new column called new column.\n","(1075.72, 1082.7)-\u003e So if we go and take a look at these now, you can see that our new column is there on the far right hand side.\n","(1082.96, 1085.96)-\u003e So what we can also do is say we weren't happy\n","(1085.96, 1086.92)-\u003e with the values in this.\n","(1087.02, 1089.38)-\u003e Well, what we can do is update that entire column.\n","(1089.48, 1091.54)-\u003e So say we wanted everything in here to read 100.\n","(1091.9, 1096.34)-\u003e Well, we can grab that column and set it equal to 100.\n","(1096.8, 1098.24)-\u003e Now, if we go and visualize it,\n","(1098.74, 1102.0)-\u003e everything within that column is reading up as 100.\n","(1102.64, 1104.98)-\u003e So that's gone and updated everything in that column.\n","(1105.92, 1110.86)-\u003e What happens if we just wanted to update a single value? For example, our first value here. Well, this is where we can use\n","(1110.86, 1114.82)-\u003e iLock to go and replace those values. So let's go and grab our first column\n","(1114.82, 1123.58)-\u003e and then set it to 10. Now, if we go and visualize that column, you can see that it's now reading as\n","(1123.58, 1126.76)-\u003e 10. So what we did is we first grabbed the value using\n","(1126.76, 1132.04)-\u003e iLock so we grabbed our first row which is zero and then we grabbed our last column which we can\n","(1132.04, 1137.08)-\u003e access by passing through negative one and then we set that value to 10. So you can see that that's\n","(1137.08, 1142.84)-\u003e now reading as 10. Now the last update methodology that I want to walk you through is how to use the\n","(1142.84, 1148.96)-\u003e apply function. So the apply function is super powerful because you can basically iterate through every value within\n","(1148.96, 1154.38)-\u003e a specific column or within your data frame and make updates appropriately using conditions. So\n","(1154.38, 1159.78)-\u003e say we wanted to take our churn column and rather than it being represented as falses and trues,\n","(1159.78, 1165.34)-\u003e we wanted it represented as ones and zeros in the new column called churn binary.\n","(1167.52, 1167.6)-\u003e Well, because there's different conditions there,\n","(1170.02, 1172.6)-\u003e what we need to do is have a little bit of filtering in order to determine how to update that value.\n","(1172.92, 1174.56)-\u003e This is where the apply method comes in.\n","(1180.26, 1181.2)-\u003e And there you go.\n","(1181.2, 1186.18)-\u003e So we've gone and used the apply method on our churn column. And then we've used\n","(1186.18, 1191.58)-\u003e lambda to basically iterate through each one of these values. And we've also used a expression\n","(1191.58, 1197.22)-\u003e here. So we've basically said it's very Pythonic. So we've basically said if x equals true, set it to\n","(1197.22, 1203.4)-\u003e one else set it to zero. So if we go and take a look at our columns now, you can see that we now\n","(1203.4, 1207.08)-\u003e have a churn binary. So let's double check that we've done that\n","(1207.08, 1215.66)-\u003e for our true values as well and you can see that if churn equals true our churn binary equals one\n","(1215.66, 1220.1)-\u003e so apply is really really powerful because you can even pass through functions in here and make\n","(1220.1, 1230.86)-\u003e updates that way just a key point to note out X is going to represent the value that you're iterating through at a point in time. That's why we've said X equals true. All right, and that about\n","(1230.86, 1236.26)-\u003e wraps up our updating section. So what we did is we dropped some rows and we specifically dropped\n","(1236.26, 1241.88)-\u003e out NAs. We've also dropped some columns. We've created new calculated columns. So specifically,\n","(1241.88, 1250.78)-\u003e we added our night minutes plus our international minutes to create our new column here. We took a look at how to update an entire column, how to update a\n","(1250.78, 1255.76)-\u003e single value. And last but not least, we took a look at how we can use the apply method to provide\n","(1255.76, 1260.76)-\u003e conditional based updates. The last thing that we're going to do is take a look at our delete\n","(1260.76, 1265.78)-\u003e and output section. So say we wanted to output a data frame to a CSV, output it to JSON\n","(1265.78, 1270.22)-\u003e or output it to HTML. This is where we're going to do it. So the first thing that we're going to\n","(1270.22, 1274.9)-\u003e take a look at is how to output a data frame to a CSV. This is pretty easy. All we need to do is\n","(1274.9, 1282.14)-\u003e type in df.2csv and then name it.
